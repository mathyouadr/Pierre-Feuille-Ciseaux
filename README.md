# 🎮 Rock — Paper — Scissors (Tkinter)

A small graphical game developed in Python as part of my introduction to **Tkinter**, the standard library for building graphical user interfaces.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The main goal of this project was to **learn and explore Tkinter**, including:
- creating a window  
- adding interactive buttons  
- displaying images  
- handling events  
- managing simple user interactions  

This game served as a practical exercise to get comfortable with Python GUI development.

## 🖥️ Overview
The application displays three buttons (Rock, Paper, Scissors).  
The user selects one, and the computer responds with a random choice.  
A visual message then indicates whether the round is won, lost, or a tie.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**  
- **Tkinter** (graphical interface)  
- **PhotoImage** for image rendering  

## 📌 Why This Project?
This project was primarily a **hands-on experiment** to understand how Tkinter works in a simple and fun way.  
It helped me learn:
- how a UI is structured  
- how user interactions are managed  
- how Tkinter widgets work  
- how to position elements and handle events
